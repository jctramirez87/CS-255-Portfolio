# CS-255-Portfolio
# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system
did they want you to design?
The owner of driverpass plans to design a software through which we can give them
a good training of driving. Most of the people he noticed that fails in driving license
test. So, he thinks that he should do something for them. He thinks that the
students fail due to lack of training.
The owner of driver pass company is our client. He wants to build a system in which
user can register himself for this course.
The system has many features that student can create his account, and then he has
ability of select his package. He can get online training and he can attempt online
exam and a trainer will give him training on road.
The owner has access to all the accounts of his employers and students. He can
download files without internet. He can delete any account if someone who leaves
the company. He will give new notification of new update.
The IT of company has access to the code of the software when there is some
problem in software, he works on software then give new updates. He has also
access of databases.
The other employer of company like drivers, help centers and other office employer
has duty of their relevant tasks and software should provide the details of their
duties.
# What did you do particularly well?
I am working well in designing the requirements of software, because this is very
important part to design a software. This is time taking and very critical part of
designing a software. I work hard and do well in this task.
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I should work on functional requirements and non-functional requirements. Because
I think that this is most important of project and this part is not complete anytime
because the requirements of project are always change according to the time, I
think that we should get requirements after some time.
I can improve this by getting feedbacks of employers and students of other
companies which are running this type of software and getting feedback to my
audience which I think give good response.
